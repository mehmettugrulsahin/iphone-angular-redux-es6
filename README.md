# An Angular 1.x subscription demo with Redux
This is a simple subscription demo built with AngularJS, [ng-redux](https://github.com/wbuchwalter/ng-redux), ES6, Webpack, and Gulp. It illustrates storing state in one place via Redux, and then using controllers to "glue" that state to the views.

## Getting Started
You will need `node` (`brew install node` or https://nodejs.org/en/) and `npm` (which ships with node).

## Installing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehmettugrulsahin/iphone-redux.git
cd iphone-redux
npm i
gulp
```

## Testing
To run the tests, run `npm test` or `karma start`.

Be sure to define your `*.spec.js` files within their corresponding component directory. You must name the spec file like so, `[name].spec.js`. If you don't want to use the `.spec.js` suffix, you must change the `regex` in `spec.bundle.js` to look for whatever file(s) you want.
`Jasmine` is the testing suite and assertion library used for this project. If you would like to change this, see `karma.conf.js`.
